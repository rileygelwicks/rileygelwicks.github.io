#### About
I am an experienced bilingual, business development, marketing and product expert with more than seven years of web industry experience in the United States and China. I recently decided to take a course at [General Assembly](//generalassemb.ly/) to further my knowledge of back-end and front-end web development.\r\rPersonally, I believe that developers are the craftsmen and builders of our age. I thoroughly enjoy creating new products from start to finish and love to experience the changes in a product as it is iterated upon.
